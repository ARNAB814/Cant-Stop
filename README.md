# Cant-Stop
Can't Stop is a board game designed by Sid Sackson originally published by Parker Brothers 
in 1980; however, that edition has been long out of print. This is a digital reincarnation 
of the classic game prepared as the final project for Memorial University CS2005 course in
Winter 2023, taught by Mark Hatcher. Feel free to try out this game and forward any bug 
reports or improvement suggestions to Arunavsaha814@gmail.com
